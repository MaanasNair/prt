 wot? why is this made just for 2 lines? i mean wtf!?

 anyway, the real reason is for custom css so i could experiment some things with the magic of css 
 (tbh i dont know much CSS, the 75% of this website's css is stolen from Apple websites like the
 glass effect on menu and the text design from spotify, lol)
